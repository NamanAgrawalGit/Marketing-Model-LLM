### **3. Creativity & Originality**

**Campaign Concept: ""Small Actions, Big Impact""**

**Storytelling Approach:**
- **Ad Story 1: ""The Ripple Effect""**
  - **Visuals**: The ad starts with a family in a home looking at a water bill that’s higher than expected. The family takes a small action by installing water-saving devices like low-flow showerheads and smart irrigation systems. Over the next few months, the bill reduces, and their yard is thriving despite the drought. The story concludes with a wide shot of the community, with the tagline: ""When we all save, the ripple effect creates change.""
  - **Narrative**: ""One home can make a difference. Together, we can save more.""
  - **Tagline**: ""Small actions, big impact. Join WaterWorks today.""

- **Ad Story 2: ""The Last Drop""**
  - **Visuals**: A lone droplet of water falls from a leaky faucet in a home. As the camera follows the drop, it turns into multiple drops across the city, each representing wasted water. The ad then shows how installing WaterWorks’ conservation products reduces waste and ensures every drop counts.
  - **Narrative**: ""Don’t let every drop go to waste. Make your home a part of the solution.""
  - **Tagline**: ""Water conservation starts at home—start today with WaterWorks.""

**Creative Twist:**
- **""Water Challenge"" Social Media Campaign**: Encourage residents to share their own water-saving practices and the difference they’ve made in their households. Those who share their experiences could win discounts on WaterWorks products or free consultations for home water audits.

**Incentives to Drive Engagement & Participation:**
- **Free Home Water Audit**: Offer a no-cost water audit for new customers to evaluate their home’s water use and suggest personalized conservation solutions.
  
- **Discounts on Water-Saving Products**: Provide a 10-15% discount on water-saving products, such as low-flow showerheads, faucet aerators, and smart irrigation systems, for customers who sign up for the service.

- **Referral Program**: Encourage current customers to refer their friends and neighbors with a ""Give $25, Get $25"" incentive—both the referrer and referee receive a discount or reward when the new customer signs up.

- **Loyalty Program**: Create a rewards system where customers earn points for every water-saving product purchased or every new referral. Points can be redeemed for additional services, such as free home audits or premium water-saving tools.

---

### **1. Target Audience Fit**

**Demographics:**
- **Primary Audience**: Adults aged 30-60 across the United States. This includes a broad demographic of men and women who are likely to have personal experience with cancer, whether through their own diagnosis, a loved one’s struggle, or simply awareness of the disease’s prevalence.
- **Secondary Audience**: Individuals who are active on social media, health-conscious, or involved in charity-driven causes. These people are motivated by the desire to make a tangible difference in the world.
  
**Interests & Motivations:**
- **Personal Connection**: Many adults have either experienced cancer personally or have seen loved ones suffer from it. They are motivated by the desire to help those who are currently affected or to prevent future cases.
- **Impact and Action**: The target audience is increasingly looking for ways to contribute to causes that resonate with them on an emotional level. They value transparency, accountability, and clear outcomes when deciding where to donate.
- **Health and Hope**: Given the constant news about medical advances, the target audience is hopeful and motivated by the potential of medical research to save lives. They believe in the power of collective action and charity.

**Why It Appeals:**
The American Cancer Society’s mission directly resonates with the target audience’s experiences and emotions. Many individuals have faced cancer in some capacity, and the desire to see a cure or improvements in treatment is universal. The call to donate, therefore, is personal, not just charitable—by donating, individuals feel they are part of the fight against cancer and closer to a solution.

**Core Message:**
_""Together, We Can Make Cancer a Thing of the Past. Your Donation Saves Lives.""_

**Why It Works:**

- **Impact**: By framing the donation as a part of a larger, life-saving mission, the message makes the audience feel empowered to make a real difference in the fight against cancer.

The grandparent shows a photo of their spouse who passed away, the parent talks about surviving cancer, and the child speaks of the hope they have for a future without cancer. 
  - **Narrative**: ""Cancer has affected our family for generations. We can’t undo the past, but we can change the future. With your help, we will make sure cancer stops here.""
  - **Tagline**: ""Donate today. Help stop cancer for good.""
  
- **Visual Story 2: ""A Life Saved""**
  - **Visuals**: A powerful video showing a cancer patient in the midst of their treatment, later followed by clips of them returning to normal life—spending time with their family, working, and laughing. The video closes with a message: “One treatment, one donation at a time. You can help make more stories like this happen.”
  - **Narrative**: ""Every donation gives hope to someone waiting for a cure. Help us change more lives.""
  - **Tagline**: ""Together, we can save lives.""

**Creative Twist:**
- **Virtual Reality Cancer Journey**: A mobile app or website feature where users can experience a 360-degree VR journey, following the life of a cancer patient. The experience will show the challenges and breakthroughs that patients face, highlighting the importance of medical research funded by donations.
  
- **""I Am The Cure"" Social Media Campaign**: Encourage people to share their stories using the hashtag #IAmTheCure. Participants can post personal stories of how cancer has affected them, with a donation link included in each post. This user-generated content will increase engagement and create a sense of community and shared purpose.

---

### **4. Use of Incentives**

**Why the Campaign Appeals:**
- Distracted driving is a growing concern among young drivers, and this campaign addresses the consequences of this dangerous behavior. It leverages the inherent desire for young people to be ""in control"" while helping them realize that distraction puts that control at risk.

Friend: ""Dude, we’re going on an adventure!""  
Man (with a blank stare): ""I’m not sure I can leave work… the spreadsheets need me.""
